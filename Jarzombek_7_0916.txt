What are the three guiding principles for this class?
Tinker, Help each other, no phones.
Why?
What does it look like in practice?
In practice this creates a learning enviornment where students will definitly lear as opposed to just been told what codes to type into the computer.
 This is because students need to think for themselves and be able to teach what they have learned.
Imagine, a student encounters a problem, a command is not working, descride the problem solving process.
Define the problem, analyse the problem, generate possibel solutions, pick the best solution, test the solution, put the solutuion into practice.
The motivation for this process is getting work done by yourself, and making the big bucks.
How does this relate to the research of Perkins et al.? 
Don't be a stopper.
